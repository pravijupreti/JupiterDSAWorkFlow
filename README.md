05/09/2024 23:16:11 ------------------ USEFUL INFORMATION ------------------
05/09/2024 23:16:11 X DAMAGE available on display, using it for polling hints.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   To disable this behavior use: '-noxdamage'
05/09/2024 23:16:11 
05/09/2024 23:16:11   Most compositing window managers like 'compiz' or 'beryl'
05/09/2024 23:16:11   cause X DAMAGE to fail, and so you may not see any screen
05/09/2024 23:16:11   updates via VNC.  Either disable 'compiz' (recommended) or
05/09/2024 23:16:11   supply the x11vnc '-noxdamage' command line option.
05/09/2024 23:16:11 
05/09/2024 23:16:11 Wireframing: -wireframe mode is in effect for window moves.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
05/09/2024 23:16:11   errors, etc) it may be disabled:
05/09/2024 23:16:11    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
05/09/2024 23:16:11    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
05/09/2024 23:16:11      moved window is released in the new position.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
05/09/2024 23:16:11   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
05/09/2024 23:16:11   periodic repaints.
05/09/2024 23:16:11 
05/09/2024 23:16:11 XFIXES available on display, resetting cursor mode
05/09/2024 23:16:11   to: '-cursor most'.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   to disable this behavior use: '-cursor arrow'
05/09/2024 23:16:11   or '-noxfixes'.
05/09/2024 23:16:11 using XFIXES for cursor drawing.
05/09/2024 23:16:11 GrabServer control via XTEST.
05/09/2024 23:16:11 
05/09/2024 23:16:11 Scroll Detection: -scrollcopyrect mode is in effect to
05/09/2024 23:16:11   use RECORD extension to try to detect scrolling windows
05/09/2024 23:16:11   (induced by either user keystroke or mouse input).
05/09/2024 23:16:11   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
05/09/2024 23:16:11   errors, etc) it may be disabled via: '-noscr'
05/09/2024 23:16:11   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
05/09/2024 23:16:11   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
05/09/2024 23:16:11   periodic repaints.
05/09/2024 23:16:11 
05/09/2024 23:16:11 Client Side Caching: -ncache mode is in effect to provide
05/09/2024 23:16:11   client-side pixel data caching.  This speeds up
05/09/2024 23:16:11   iconifying/deiconifying windows, moving and raising
05/09/2024 23:16:11   windows, and reposting menus.  In the simple CopyRect
05/09/2024 23:16:11   encoding scheme used (no compression) a huge amount
05/09/2024 23:16:11   of extra memory (20-100MB) is used on both the server and
05/09/2024 23:16:11   client sides.  This mode works with any VNC viewer.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   However, in most you can actually see the cached pixel
05/09/2024 23:16:11   data by scrolling down, so you need to re-adjust its size.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   See http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/faq.html#faq-client-caching.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   If this mode yields undesired behavior (poor response,
05/09/2024 23:16:11   painting errors, etc) it may be disabled via: '-ncache 0'
05/09/2024 23:16:11   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
05/09/2024 23:16:11   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
05/09/2024 23:16:11   periodic repaints.
05/09/2024 23:16:11 
05/09/2024 23:16:11 XKEYBOARD: number of keysyms per keycode 7 is greater
05/09/2024 23:16:11   than 4 and 51 keysyms are mapped above 4.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   Automatically switching to -xkb mode.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   If this makes the key mapping worse you can
05/09/2024 23:16:11   disable it with the "-noxkb" option.
05/09/2024 23:16:11   Also, remember "-remap DEAD" for accenting characters.
